My final project for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development course is a responsive site for Ali Hoge's design & development portfolio created by Ali Hoge. There are no special instructions.

Built using html5, css3, javascript, and Bootstrap4 framework.


The current code incorporates placeholder links and text. The img file has files that have not been used yet.
